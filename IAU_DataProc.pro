;
; 2017-12-21 (v1.26, FO)
; - bugfix for restoring old version dp data: now also works with files that contain multiple experiments.

;
; 2017-11-27 (v1.26, FO)
; - bugfix on main widget: experiment type droplist; 'undef' case now covered by case statement.
;
; 2017-11-24 (v1.26, FO)

;   estimated mr of the cal.
; - dataproc wid: added "reset" option for cal mixing ratios (PRO dp_remv_calmrs).

; - call relrespcalc routine: added keyword AUTO_SAMTREAT. If set, sample blocks are checked if multiple samples are
;   found within one block. if yes, treatment 'individual' is selected automatically.
; - dp_analyse_seq: bugfix on check for multiple individual samples in one sample block.

; 2016-09-15 (v1.01 beta, first beta-testing...)
; - created functions create_ref_instrprc and create_ref_calmrs to prepare the inclusion of instrument precision values
;   and calibration gas mixing rations. structures are added to dp_expcfg in dp_read_expinfo procedure
; - cal interpol: preceding method, from the last cal block a point is selected that would correspont to a cal point
;   that would precede the next sample assuming a typical block length (which is dynamically determined from the sequence
;   as the median of all cal blocks)
; - removed 'manual' from sample and cal treat methods
; - dp_interpol_cal: programmed 'block_mean', method
; - rres structure: cal_block_rsd is now calculated and written to struct if cal treat method is 'block_mean'
; - dp_interpol_cal: programmed 'calmeans','linear_fit' and 'polyfit_dg2' interpolation methods
; - dp_calc_relresp: programmed 'block_last...' methods
;
; 2016-09-13 (v0.9 alpha)
; - created PRO dp_dpres2txt to allow txt export of results. Can export results for all files of the selected experiment
;   to individual txt files or the selected substance of the selected experiment to a txt file.
; - added function jultime2timestring to tools folder. does what the name says.
; - introduced ECD data compatibility
; - rres structure: added cal_block_rsd
; - dp_interpol_cal: programmed 'preceding' method
;
; 2016-09-12 (v0.8 alpha)
; - dp_read_expinfo: outsourced actual expinfo import to functions dp_get_[...]_expinfo.
; - made the expinfo import work for lab, fastof and ghost
; - bugfix on dp_correct_time, now actually works
; - bugfix on dp_calc_relresp, now doesnt corrupt sam_treat_mthd variable
; - added update of cal treat / sam treat / cal ip droplists if another substance is selected.
; - indroduced 'apply manual changes' functionality; individual substances can now be evaluated with different
;   cal treat / sam treat / cal ip methods.
; - dp_modify_plot: changed determination of x- and yrange
; - modified plot rres: if there is no valid data, nothing is plotted
;
; 2016-09-09 (v0.7 alpha)
; - minor tweaks, overwriting of loaded data and cdf-file timestamp correction
;
; 2016-09-08 (v0.7 alpha)
; - restored plot functionality: plot diagnostic
; - renamed dp_wid_table_ini to dp_wid_restable_ini. made it non-editable as it should only show results.
; - restored functionality: show results table
; - introduced rres.eval_flag to handle the state of the data evaluation (0 = not evaluated, >0 = evaluated)
; - sequence analyser is now only called if sequence was not analysed yet
; - added error handler
; - if dp save file is restored: update settings of instr/exp type/spec droplists
; - if expinfo file(s) is/are overwritten, eval_flag is reset to 0
;
; 2016-09-07 (v0.6 alpha)
; - main wid: activated path change option
; - dp wid: treat droplist checks & minor tweaks
; - introduced general cal treat and sam treat options as common variables. options for individual experiments depend
;   on the sequence of the experiment.
; - introduced core calculation PRO dp_call_relresp_calc, FUNCTION dp_interpol_cal and FUNCTION dp_calc_relresp.
;   made it basically functional with bracketing cal option and sample block means.
; - summarised Stephan's plot functions in dp_plot_tools.pro
; - restored plot functionality: plot normalised responses
;
; 2016-09-06 (v0.5 alpha)
; - introduced PRO dp_analyse_seq to analyse the measurement sequence. This experiment-specific property is written to
;   dp_expcfg. Knowledge of the sequence (position of cals, blocksize of samples etc.) is needed to apply different
;   cal- and sample-treatment methods (to be selected on dataproc wid).
;
; 2016-09-05 (v0.4 alpha)
; - changed data structure: removed expinfo substructure from dp_chrom as this is not chromatogram-specific information
;   but experiment specific. created structure dp_expcfg for that purpose.
;   - added: dp_expcfg.sequence <- sequence information needed for choosing cal and sample treatment
;   - added: dp_expcfg.setup <- instrument, experiment type, experiment specification; needed for restoring dp files etc.
;   - implemented main widget refresh if data is loaded or a selection is made
;
; 2016-09-02 (v0.3 alpha)
; - changed widget structure; introduced second widget where the actual "processing" can take place. The idea was to
;   keep the code of the main widget readable.
;
; 2016-09-01 (v0.2 alpha)
; - import exp-info:
;   - simplified tag comparison of imported file and default (removed col strct)
;   - added string operation; allows the removal of certain phrases before the comparison of filenames given in dp_chrom
;     and expinfo ("remove_strings", l.218)
;   - added save and restore capability for the data that is being processed (incomplete)
;
; 2016-08-30 (v0.1 alpha)
; - "reboot" version; restructured MAIN wid, removed hidden fields.
;   - restructured experiment handling: multiple chrom files can now be imported into a LIST
;   - new structural tags are created upon import in dp_restore_chrom FUNCTION
;   - dp_correct_time: adjusted for dp_chrom in LIST structure
;   - main_wid: added basic configuration capability (instrument, experiment type)
